# data science engineer cheat sheets

I have had many notes about different tech stuck that I use some times as a quick refresher point. That happens
often when I have been for some without using it.
This repo starts as an attempt to organise these notes.
Of course it doesn't intended to be a substitute of any dev documentation which will be more up to date in many cases
and more comprehensive but instead be a first quick toolkit point.
